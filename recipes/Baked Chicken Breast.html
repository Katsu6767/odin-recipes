<br>
        <li><b>Salt:</b> Use your favorite coarse sea salt for the most delicious results.</li>
<br>
        <li><b>Creole Seasoning: </b>Creole seasoning adds flavor and a bit of welcome heat.</li>
<br>
        <li><b>Chicken Broth</b> You'll use chicken broth to make an easy pan sauce to pour over the baked chicken.</li>
</ul>
