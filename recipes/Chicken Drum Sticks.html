<h1>Ingredients</h1>

    <li>6 (4 ounce) bone-in chicken drumsticks, with skin</li>

<br>
    <li>Â½ cup extra-virgin olive oil, divided</li>

<h1>Directions</h1>

<ul>

    <li> <b>Step 1:</b>Step 1: Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Line a glass baking dish with aluminum foil.</li>
<br>
    <li><b>Step 2:</b>Spread 1/4 cup of olive oil over the bottom of the prepared baking dish and line up drumsticks on top, alternating directions so that they fit. Top with 1 tablespoon of butter each, on the thick part of the chicken. 
        Sprinkle with garlic salt, seasoned salt, salt, and pepper.</li>
<br>
    <li><b>Step 3:</b>Bake in the preheated oven for 35 minutes. Cover chicken with remaining olive oil; continue to bake until juices run clear and chicken is no longer pink in the centers, 10 to 15 more minutes. 
        An instant-read thermometer inserted near the bone should read 165 degrees F (74 degrees C). Serve.</li>
